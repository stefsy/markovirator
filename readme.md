# Markovirator 

Work in progress, on github just so I don't lose it. 

Compares texts to see how mashupable they are via Markov pseudo-random text generation. 
2-gram 

Comparing the 2-gram key values seems to be a valid approach so far. As expected, 
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes vs. The Return of Sherlock Holmes has the highest 
match value. 

Holmes vs Holmes 0.13214838352
Holmes vs. Mystery at Styles 0.103376868349
Holmes vs. Grimms' Tales 0.0933396949937
Mystery at Styles vs. Grimms' 0.0829907246313
